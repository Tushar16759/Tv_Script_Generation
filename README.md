# Tv_Script_Generation

Udacity Project 4: DLND-Tv-Script-Generation

In this project I generated Simpsons TV scripts, for a scene at Moe's Tavern, using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). This model uses a part of the [Simpsons dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data) of scripts from 27 seasons. 

Topics Covered:
*Recurrent Neural Networks
*Tensorflow
*Embeddings
*LSTMs
*Word2Vec
